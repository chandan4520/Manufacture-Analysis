### Data Sources

Fact Bookings table: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "fact_bookings.csv" file,containing detailed information about each revenue made by the hotels.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning and for insights also
- MYSQL - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports
- Tableau - Creating reports


### Data Cleaning/Preparation
 
 In the initial data preparationphase, we performed the following tasks:
 1. Data loading and inspection.
 2. Handling missing values.
 3. Data cleaning and formatting. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the fact booking data to answer key questions,such as:

 - What is the total revenue,bookings and cancellation rate?
 - which city and hotels are gained highest revenue?
 - which day has given the peak highest revenue?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with

```SELECT city, property_name, FORMAT(SUM(f.revenue_realized),'no') AS `total revenue`
FROM dim_hotels AS d INNER JOIN fact_bookings AS f
ON d.property_id = f.property_id
GROUP BY city, property_name
OREDR BY city;```


### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarised as follows:
1. The hotels revenue have been more in weekdays compared to weekends becuase weekday has more number of days compared to weekend.
2. Atliq bay(mumbai) is the best-performing hotels in terms of bookings and revenue.
3. Customers are highly prefering to book Elite Room class compared to any other.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Improving Hotel Efficiency and Guest Services in Delh.
- Encourage guests to visit Atliq Grands hotel.
- Reducing Cancellation Rates through Enhanced Booking Practices.

 ### Limitations

  I had to remove all zero values from revenue columns becuase they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis.There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we 
  can 
  still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
